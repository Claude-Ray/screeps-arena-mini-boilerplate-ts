** Recipes

- auto-completion: [[https://github.com/screepers/typed-screeps-arena][typed-screeps-arena]] is still WIP.
  Sometimes it's buggy, then you need to lock the version to =#commit= instead of the branch =#develop=.

- bundler: rollup.

- linter: Use tslint instead of eslint since [[https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide][tide]] is not fully support eslint.
